            Python is a high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Created by Guido van Rossum in 1991, it is widely used in a variety of domains, from web development and task automation to data analysis and artificial intelligence. Its clean and easy-to-understand syntax makes Python a popular choice for both beginners and experienced programmers. With an active community and a vast standard library, Python provides a robust platform for building a wide range of software projects. Let's explore the potential of this programming language.

          <p>
            In Python, printing "Hello, world!" is as simple as:
          </p>
          <code>print("Hello, world!")</code>
          <p>
            This single line of code will output "Hello, world!" to the console when executed. It's often the first program people write when learning a new language, serving as a basic introduction to the syntax and structure of the language.

          <p>
            Variables are used to store data values. Unlike some other programming languages, Python does not require explicit declaration of variables before using them. You can simply assign a value to a variable, and Python will create the variable for you. It can contain letters, numbers, and underscores, but they cannot start with a number. Python is case-sensitive, so "myVar" and "myvar" are treated as different variables.
          </p>
          <p>
            Python is dynamically typed, meaning that you do not need to specify the data type of a variable when you create one. The data type of a variable is determined automatically based on the value assigned to it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here's a simple example of variable usage in Python:
          </p>
          <code># Assigning values to variables
x = 5
y = "Hello, world!"

# Printing the variables
print(x)
print(y)</code>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="variable_scope">
        <header class="content-header">Variable Scope</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Variable scope refers to the region of the code where a variable is accessible. Python has two main types of variable scope: global scope and local scope.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <span class="bold">Global Scope: </span>Variables defined outside of any function or class have global scope. They can be accessed from anywhere within the code, including inside functions and classes.
              </p>
            </li>
            <code>x = 10  # Global variable

def my_function():
    print(x)  # Accessing global variable inside function

my_function()  # Output: 10</code>
            <li>
              <p>
                <span class="bold">Local Scope: </span>Variables defined inside a function have local scope. They are only accessible within the function in which they are defined.
              </p>
            </li>
            <code>def my_function():
    y = 20  # Local variable
    print(y)

my_function()  # Output: 20

# Trying to access y outside the function will result in an error
print(y)  # NameError: name 'y' is not defined</code>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Additionally, Python has a concept of enclosing scope, which occurs when functions are nested within each other. In such cases, inner functions can access variables from outer functions.
          </p>
          <code>def outer_function():
    z = 30  # Enclosing variable
    
    def inner_function():
        print(z)  # Accessing enclosing variable
    
    inner_function()

outer_function()  # Output: 30</code>
          <p>
            However, modifying a global variable from within a function requires the use of the 'global' keyword.
          </p>
          <code>x = 10

def my_function():
    global x
    x = 20  # Modifying global variable

print(x)  # Output: 10
my_function()
print(x)  # Output: 20</code>

      <section class="main-section" id="constants">

        <article>
          <p>
            There is no built-in mechanism to define constants in the same way as some other programming languages. However, it is a common convention to use uppercase variable names to represent constants and to refrain from modifying their values throughout the program. While this doesn't enforce immutability, it serves as a visual cue to other developers that the variable should not be changed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here's an example of how you might define constants in Python:
          </p>
          <code># Define constants
PI = 3.14159
GRAVITY = 9.8
MAX_SPEED = 300

# Usage of constants
radius = 5
area = PI * (radius ** 2)
print("Area of the circle:", area)

# Attempt to modify a constant (not recommended)
PI = 3.14  # This will raise an error or modify the variable, which is not intended for constants</code>
          <p>
            Although Python doesn't strictly enforce the immutability of variables marked as constants, it's good practice to treat them as such and avoid modifying them throughout your codebase. Additionally, if immutability is critical, you can use immutable data types like tuples or frozen sets to represent constants, but this approach is less common and may be overly verbose for simple cases.

            Python supports various data types that allow you to store and manipulate different kinds of data. Here are some of the fundamental data types in Python:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="bold">Numeric Types: </span></li>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="bold">int: </span>Integers</li>
              <li><span class="bold">float: </span>Floating-point numbers</li>
            </ul>
            <li><span class="bold">Sequence Types: </span></li>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="bold">str: </span>Strings</li>
              <li><span class="bold">list: </span>Ordered and mutable sequences of objects</li>
              <li><span class="bold">tuple: </span>Ordered and immutable sequences of objects</li>
            </ul>
            <li><span class="bold">Mapping Type: </span></li>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="bold">dict: </span>Unordered collection of key-value pairs</li>
            </ul>
            <li><span class="bold">Set Types: </span></li>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="bold">set: </span>Unordered collection of unique elements</li>
              <li><span class="bold">frozenset: </span>Immutable set</li>
            </ul>
            <li><span class="bold">Boolean Type: </span></li>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="bold">bool: </span>Represents truth values True and False.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><span class="bold">None Type: </span></li>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="bold">None: </span>Represents the absence of a value or a null value.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <p>Python also supports complex numbers ('complex' type) for representing complex mathematical operations.</p>

        <article>
          <p>
            the 'if', 'elif' (short for "else if"), and 'else' statements are used for conditional execution of code blocks. Here's the basic syntax:
          </p>
          <code>if condition1:
    # Execute this block if condition1 is True
    statement1
    statement2
    # ...
elif condition2:
    # Execute this block if condition1 is False and condition2 is True
    statement3
    statement4
    # ...
else:
    # Execute this block if both condition1 and condition2 are False
    statement5
    statement6
    # ...</code>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                The <span class="bold">if </span>statement checks a condition and executes a block of code if the condition is true.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The <span class="bold">elif </span>statement allows you to check additional conditions if the preceding 'if' or 'elif' conditions are false. You can have multiple 'elif' blocks if needed.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The <span class="bold">else </span>statement is optional and provides a default block of code to execute when none of the preceding conditions are true.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </article>

      <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">

        <article>
          <p>
          The 'while' loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a condition is true. Here's the basic syntax:
        </p>
        <code>while condition:
    # Execute this block of code as long as the condition is true
    statement1
    statement2
    # ...</code>
          <p>
            The loop will continue iterating as long as the 'condition' evaluates to 'True'. If the condition becomes 'False', the loop terminates, and the program continues with the next statement after the loop.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's important to ensure that the condition in a 'while' loop eventually becomes 'False', or else the loop will continue indefinitely, leading to what's known as an infinite loop. Infinite loops can cause your program to hang or become unresponsive, so it's essential to avoid them by designing your loop conditions carefully.

          <p>
            You can define functions using the 'def' keyword followed by the function name and its parameters. Here's the basic syntax for function declarations: 
          </p>
          <code>def function_name(parameter1, parameter2, ...):
    # Function body
    statement1
    statement2
    # ...
    return value  # Optional: return statement</code>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                <span class="bold">def: </span>Keyword used to define a function.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <span class="bold">function_name: </span>Name of the function.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <span class="bold">parameter1, parameter2,...: </span>Parameters (input) that the function accepts. These are optional.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <span class="bold">return: </span>Optional keyword used to return a value from the function.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Functions in Python can also have default parameter values and can return multiple values using tuples. Additionally, Python supports lambda functions for creating small anonymous functions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Functions are fundamental building blocks in Python programming, allowing you to encapsulate reusable pieces of code and promote code organization and reusability.
